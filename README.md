Welcome to HomeHack!

An intuitive Social Media app for home improvement DIYers to display projects, learn, get inspired, and connect with others. 
HomeHack is a Full Stack Web Application built in the Django Framework using Python, HTML, CSS. 
The goal of this project was to create a fun and useful application using relational databases. 
Using my MySQL I architected a database structure that allows users to search by user, tools required for a project, project type, and cost so that users can be inspired to build and create with the knowledge and help from others.
Take a look around, get inspired, have fun!
